     Organisation History
========================= -->
<section>
  <h1>Organisation's History</h1>
  <p>
    Helping Hands Animal Rescue South Africa was founded in October 2009 by Athol Fenderick. 
    Per year in South Africa, over 20 000 cases of abandoned, hurt, and unhealthy animals are reported. 
    Helping Hands SA was created to improve the lives of abused and abandoned animals, providing shelter, 
    nutrition, and love. With the help of a committed support committee and generous followers, 
    we raise funds through events such as picnics where you can bring your furry friend and interact with others, 
    making long-lasting friendships while improving the lives of animals. We strongly support no-kill shelters 
    and aim to raise awareness about animal cruelty and neglect.
